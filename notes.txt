Oracle Problem:
cant read or listen data from real world

Oracle: any device that interacts with offchain worldto provide external data or computaion to smart contracts

Hybrid Smart Contracts: decentralized network + decentralized Oracle, have some offchain component

Chainlink, decent oracle networks

struct (new)
usage:     People public person = People({favoriteNumber:2, name:"Jane"});

    struct People{
        uint256 favoriteNumber;
        string name;
    }
note: fav gets indexed to 0 and name  to 1,wheneevr obj like this, automatically indexed

red error not compiled
yellow warning compiled

calldata temp non-modifiable
memory temp modifiable
storage perm modifiable

choose test net and then go to chain.link to get test eth for the test net, then change iin the remix to inject and connect and deploy


side note: metamasl can be connected through rainbow wallet
no resource for metamask to next
